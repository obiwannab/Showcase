# Showcase
### These are projects that I am most proud of and exemplify the kind of coding I enjoy working on the most.

* __FileTransferGUI.py__
    * Python 3.4
    * tKinter built GUI
    * Script will move files from one folder to another using a saved timestamp from the previous file transfer
    * the GUI allows users to select both the source and destination folders and provides feedback about the transfer
    * a timestamp is saved whenever a file transfer is performed using a SQLite Database

* __CS-ASP_051 - MegaChallenge2.sln__
    * C# with ASP.NET Web App; the file is a Visual Studio 2013 Community solution
    * simulation of the simple card game, War
    * the only user interaction is entering player names
    * the goal was to utilize mutliple classes to handle all the aspects of the game; my first attempt at separation of concerns.
    * I have program logic that determines if a player can continue to draw cards, however I have not handled exiting the predetermined 20 rounds if this happens before the rounds are up.
    * I utilized a Stack<T> collection for the different "decks" in the game which I thought would be a good fit with Push() and Pop().  However, I have not yet handled continuing the game by repopulating the players' hands with their winnings, which I could not implement because of the nature of the Stack<T> collection.

* __CS-ASP_034 - MegaChallenge1__
    * C# with ASP.NET Web App; the file is a Visual Studio 2013 Community solution
    * simulation of a slot machine app
    * the goal was to incorporate several C# skills into a single application, including conditional logic, ViewState, and methods.

* __PHP Course Final__
    * HTML5/CSS3 with PHP and JavaScript
    * a login page that utilizes MySQL for authentication
    * the goal was to create a self-submitting page but also incorporate some simple JavaScript features for a future web application for personal use
